                        The house of the brave, loyal, courageous, adventurous, daring, and chivalrous. 
                        Those who stand up for others are typically Gryffindors. Brave-hearted is the most 
                        well-known Gryffindor characteristic, and Gryffindors are also known for having a 
                        lot of nerve. Gryffindors are people who hold a multitude of qualities alongside the ones 
                        listed, making them a very well-rounded house. People who are Gryffindors are often people
                        who could fit nicely into another house but choose to tell the sorting hat they want 
                        Gryffindor (there's that bravery). "Do what is right" is the motto Gryffindors go by. Being 
                        a Gryffindor means that you're probably an adventurous and courageous friend, and you are usually known for doing what is right.
